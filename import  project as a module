first you need to improt project as a module in your project.

after that we need to change in setting.gradle file like as:

include ':app'
include ':myExternalLib'
project(':myExternalLib').projectDir=new File('/Users/madept/Documents/mdept@dev/munbyn_printer/TestSk/sdk')



now open your project level build.gradle file and add these line


allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()

        flatDir {
            dirs "${project(':myExternalLib').projectDir}/libs"
        }
    }
}

check this link for add module for more detials;


now add app level build.gradle file this line

implementation project(':myExternalLib')



and also change in module project :


You might be importing Application instead of Module. Well you can change it in module's gradle also.

Change

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
to

apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

You also need to remove applicationId from the gradle.
